What is sliding Window?
    A sliding window is sublist or subarray which is running on underlying data structure and 
    in general the underlying data structure is a iterable and ordered.

    It normally encompasses searching for a longest, shortest or optimal sequence 
    that satisfies a given condition.

When to use Sliding window?
    Whenever you need to calculate a running average
    If you want to formulate a set of adjacent pairs
    The problem involves an ordered data structure
    If you need to identify a target value in an array
    If you need to identify a longest, shortest, or 
    most optimal sequence that satisfies a given condition in a collection
